# Monty-Hall-Extra
### Exploring the Monty Mall problems and its variations
The project aims to explore the famous Monty Hall problem, which challenges our intuition about probabilities. The setup involves three doors to choose from: behind one of these doors is a car (the prize), and behind the rest are goats. After the player chooses a door, the host, who knows what is behind each door, opens one of the remaining doors to reveal a goat. The main point is that the player then obtains a chance to stay with their choice or switch to another door. Surprisingly, switching gives a winning probability of 2/3, while staying at the same door only gives a chance of 1/3.

In this project, I plan to observe the problem by experimenting with these variations:
  1.) Adding more doors: How does the probability of winning change as the number of doors increases?
  2.) Multiple goats or prizes: What happens when there are different prize distributions instead of one car and the rest goats?
  3.) Host strategies: How do probabilities shift if the host behaves differently (e.g., randomly opening doors or not always revealing a goat)?

By simulating these scenarios, I aim to explore how probability behaves in more complex versions of the Monty Hall problem and to provide visualizations that make the outcomes intuitive.
After finishing the project, I might consider observing on some interesting game show.  (if the project is done successfully.)

### To be updated
  the project is still in progress :).
