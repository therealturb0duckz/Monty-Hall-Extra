# Monty-Hall-Extra
### Exploring the Monty Mall problems and its variations

This project explores the famous **Monty Hall problem**, a probability puzzle that challenges our intuition.  

In the classic setup:  
- There are **3 doors**: behind one is a **car (prize)**, and behind the other two are **goats**.  
- The player chooses a door.  
- The host, who knows what‚Äôs behind each door, opens one of the remaining doors to reveal a goat.  
- The player can then **stay** with their original choice or **switch** to the other unopened door.  

Surprisingly:  
- **Switching** gives a **2/3 chance of winning**.  
- **Staying** gives only a **1/3 chance of winning**.

## üîç Variations Explored  
By simulating these scenarios, I aim to see how probability behaves in more complex versions of the Monty Hall problem and to provide visualizations that make the outcomes intuitive.

1. **Adding more doors** ‚Äì How does the probability of winning change as the number of doors increases?  
2. **Multiple goats or prizes** ‚Äì What happens when there are different prize distributions instead of just one car and the rest goats?  
3. **Host strategies** ‚Äì How do probabilities shift if the host behaves differently (e.g., randomly opening doors or not always revealing a goat)?

After finishing the project, I might consider observing some interesting game shows (if the project is done successfully).
